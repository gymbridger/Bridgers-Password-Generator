# Bridgers-Password-Generator

## Description

This project is a basic password generator. I used JavaScript to make it so someone could create a random password.

## Installation

Clone the repository.
Open the index.html file.

## Usage

Click the "Generate Password" button and enter a desired password length (8-128). Then a random password will show up.
